Part-1 Using GraphFrames and Pyspark
This project implements graph analysis using PySpark and GraphFrames, starting from data ingestion, cleaning, and schema creation. The script builds vertex–edge structures, constructs a GraphFrame, and performs tasks such as PageRank, connected components, and degree computation. It also includes data transformations, joins, and visual summaries to understand network relationships. The code forms a complete workflow for scalable big-data graph processing.
