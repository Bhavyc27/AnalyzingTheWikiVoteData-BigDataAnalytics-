Part-1 Using GraphFrames and Pyspark
This project implements graph analysis using PySpark and GraphFrames, starting from data ingestion, cleaning, and schema creation. The script builds vertex–edge structures, constructs a GraphFrame, and performs tasks such as PageRank, connected components, and degree computation. It also includes data transformations, joins, and visual summaries to understand network relationships. The code forms a complete workflow for scalable big-data graph processing.

Part-2 Scratch Implementation Using Pyspark

This project uses PySpark to perform large-scale graph preprocessing, edge cleaning, and schema reconstruction for network analysis tasks. It loads and prepares raw edge data, handles bidirectional edge expansion, removes duplicates, and builds a structured, optimized graph representation. The code performs transformations such as filtering, joining, aggregation, and caching to enable efficient graph computations. Overall, it forms a scalable workflow for preparing real-world graph datasets for algorithms like PageRank, connected components, and traversal.
